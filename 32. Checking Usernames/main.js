/*Question # 32
Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
• Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
• Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
• Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.
• Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.*/
var current_users = ["User1", "User2", "Mark", "User4", "User5"];
var new_users = ["User1", "Zack", "Julie", "Mark", "Louis"];
new_users.forEach(function (newUser) {
    if (current_users.some(function (currentUser) { return currentUser.toLowerCase() === newUser.toLowerCase(); })) {
        console.log("".concat(newUser, " will need to enter a new username."));
    }
    else {
        console.log("".concat(newUser, " is available."));
    }
});
